# CSCI202-Final-Project-DuncanStephenson
 M08 - Final Project
The program used sqlite, openssl-32, and Qt 6.5.2
To run the program open the loginSystemGUI folder and either run the exe or build the program youself by opening the solution file in Visual Studio.
The default Administrator login is username: 'admin' and password: 'password'.
I have 5 cpp files and one  header file which do the following:

# main.cpp

This is the main entry point of the program. It contains the main function that is executed when the program runs. It starts the main login window.

# loginSystem.h

This header file contains the declarations of various functions used in the program. It provides the function prototypes that allow other parts of the program to use these functions. 

# login.cpp

This source file implements the functions declared involved in logging in or registering users.

# table.cpp

This source file implements the functionality related to the table used in the program. It may include functions for creating a table, adding or removing entries, searching and sorting the table, and any other operations related to the table. The code should be well-organized and commented to enhance readability and maintainability.

# hash.cpp

This source file implements the hash function used in the program. It contains the salting and hash functions for passwords.

# admin.cpp

This source file contains the administrative functionality of the program. It include functions for adding, deleting, and managing users. You can also view the table from here. Make sure to document the functions effectively, providing clear explanations of their purpose and any input/output requirements.
